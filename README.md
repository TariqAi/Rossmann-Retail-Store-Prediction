# Rossmann-Retail-Store-Prediction
## Summary
This project aims to predict the daily sales of 1,115 Rossmann stores across Europe for up to six weeks in advance using machine learning regression models. The model takes into consideration various factors that influence store sales, such as promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and locality.

This dataset is a live dataset of Roseman Stores. On analsysing this problem we observe that Roseman problem is a regression problem and our primarily goal is to predict the sales figures of Roseman problem.

In this project, I have attempted to analyze the retail sales dataset of Rossmann stores and build a predictive model to forecast the sales of any Rossmann store for any date. No personal information of customer is provided in this dataset.

In this Notebook we work on following topics:

Analysing the Dataset by using Exploratory Data Analysis. Using Exponential Moving Averages analyse Trends and Seasonality in Roseman dataset. Analyse Regression analysis using following prediction analysis, A. Linear Regression Analysis B. Elastic Regression ( Lasso and Ridge Regression). C. Random Forest Regression. d.Xgboost).
